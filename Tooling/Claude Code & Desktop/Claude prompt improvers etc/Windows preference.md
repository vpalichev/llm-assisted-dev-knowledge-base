# System Preferences

- I'm using Windows 10/11
- When suggesting shell commands, prefer PowerShell or Git Bash compatible syntax
- Be explicit about path separators (use forward slashes when possible for cross-compatibility)
- Note when commands might behave differently on Windows vs Unix-like systems
- When file paths contain spaces, remind me about proper quoting in different shells
