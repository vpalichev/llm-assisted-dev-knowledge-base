When shadow-cljs receives an eval through its nREPL server, the middleware checks whether the current session has been switched to CLJS mode via `(shadow/repl :app)`. If it hasn't, the middleware prepends a three-line informational banner reminding you how to switch. Since `clj-nrepl-eval` creates a fresh CLJ-mode session for every invocation, the banner appears on every single call — there is no way to suppress it. The eval still executes normally in Clojure on the JVM, and the result follows the banner after the `=>` marker. This is by design in shadow-cljs and is not an error, a warning, or a sign that something went wrong.
